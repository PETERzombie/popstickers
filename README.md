hi folks, I am a beginner hacker who has an interest in web based deep learning models and web security. I am currently working on a basic website outlined below. my education is in molecular biology and food safety. 



# popstickers
A Small Django App showcasing sticker art project is created by Jim Shebib of Newfoundland,  Canada. The art is mainly a showcase of his daughters stickers and other art with the aim of creating a backend that can host users and provide sales services. 


the app was successfully deployed to Railway on a free tier. still lots if things to do. currently I am working with both bootstrap and general css to organize the front end. you can follow the project at: https://popstickers-production.up.railway.app/
